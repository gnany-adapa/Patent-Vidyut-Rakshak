# Vidyut Rakshak: Power Line Inspection Robot

## Overview
Vidyut Rakshak is an innovative power line inspection robot designed to enhance safety and efficiency in maintaining high-power transmission lines. Traditional inspection methods are hazardous and expensive, involving heavy lifting equipment and insulation for workers. Vidyut Rakshak offers a cost-effective and safer alternative.

## Features
- **Visual Inspection**: Equipped with a pan and tilt servo assembly, the robot visually inspects power lines from all angles.
- **Nuts and Bolts Tightening**: Uses robotic arms with an aligning system and motors with bolt sockets to tighten loosened nuts and bolts.
- **Cost-Effective**: Reduces the need for heavy lifting equipment and extensive safety measures, lowering maintenance costs.
- **Safety Enhancement**: Minimizes the risk to workers by performing inspections and maintenance tasks autonomously.

## Benefits
- **Reduces Risk**: Decreases the number of fatalities and injuries among maintenance workers.
- **Efficiency**: Streamlines the inspection and maintenance process, saving time and resources.
- **Reliability**: Ensures power line integrity by promptly addressing wear and tear and loose components.
